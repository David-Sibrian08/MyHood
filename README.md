## Limitations/ Bugs
Deleting a post causes all other posts to be deleted upon relaunch of the app. Posts will remain if none are deleted however. 
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/David-Sibrian08/MyHood/blob/2a9b3aa4ac25735ee69fc14b9e7fe3b6dadff07a/MyHood/DataService.swift#L47-L65). I may have made a mistake.
